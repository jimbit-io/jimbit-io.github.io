Howdy! ðŸ¤ 

2023 is here! A fresh new year which, for me, starts off with a new years resolution to hopefully return some value to the www which has taught me so much.

Over here I will try to focus my posts as much as possible on providing relatively easy to understand tutorials, scripts and how-to's with a strong focus towards real-life IT situations.

Points of interest at time of writing are:
{% highlight posh %}
$interests = @{
    Networking          = "Cisco, Palo Alto, Fortinet"
    Scripting           = "PowerShell, Python"
    Automation          = $true
    Trends              = "Zero Trust Network Access, IaC"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Thanks for dropping by, and hopefully see you soon.

ðŸ‘‹ Jim
