Howdy! ðŸ¤ 

2023 is here. A fresh new year which, for me, starts off with a new years resolution to hopefully return some value to the www which has taught me so much over the years.

Over here I will try to focus my posts as much as possible on providing relatively easy to understand tutorials, scripts and how-to's with a strong focus towards real-life IT (networking) challenges.

### Points of interest at time of writing are:
{% highlight posh %}
$interests = @{
    Networking     = "Cisco, Palo Alto, Fortinet"
    Infrastructure = "Azure"
    Scripting      = "PowerShell, Python"
    Automation     = $true
    Trends         = "Zero Trust, IaC"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Thanks for dropping by, and hopefully see you soon.
